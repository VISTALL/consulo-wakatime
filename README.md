1. Inside your IDE, select `Preferences` -> `Plugins` -> `Browse Repositories...`.

2. Search for `WakaTime`.
   
3. Click the green `Install Plugin` button.

4. Click `Close` and `OK`, then Re-launch your IDE.

5. Enter your [api key](https://wakatime.com/settings#apikey) from [https://wakatime.com/settings#apikey](https://wakatime.com/settings#apikey), then click `Save`.

6. Use your IDE like you normally do and your time will be tracked for you automatically.
